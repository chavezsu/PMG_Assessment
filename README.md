# PGM technical assessment

Hello, I have attached my SQL statements for each question on the "answers.sql" file. 

I’m not sure if we are supposed to run the SQL queries on Github, but I've never ran code on this platform. I’ve used Snowflake and MySQL Workbench before.

For the quesitons that require answers such as "How much revenue did the third best state generate?" or "Which state generated the most conversions for this campaign"?, I downloaded the three files: campaign, marketing_performance, and website_revenue and created pivot tables for the data to answer those questions. 

Thank you so much for your time and consideration for the position. 

I look forward to hearing back!

Susan Chavez
